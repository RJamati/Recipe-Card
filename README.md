This repo contains the code for the June 2021 Week 1 Recipe Card CodePen Challenge.

# Preparing the Project
I opted to use Visual Studio Code instead of CodePen as it allows me to use VS Code's advanced code completion features.

I started off by creating the index.html file and I also installed SCSS into the project.

I used SCSS/SASS for this project because it will allow me to write and manage my CSS quickly and efficiently.

# HTML
The HTML was provided by CodePen, however some edits were made to it.

I have formatted the HTML into separate sections in order to make it clean and readable.

A background image wrapper was added.

A Container was added in order to center the layout on desktop.

SVGs were used for the icons, SVGs provided by BootStrap Icons.

# SASS/CSS
SASS is used in this project as it allows for more legible code when working within nested elements.

Normalize CSS was added so the design will look consistent in all the browsers.

Crimson Text and Playfair Display fonts were imported in the SASS.

The colors and fonts used in this project are listed as variables, so they can be easily changed if required.

Flex box was used to layout the page.

Media queries were used in order to create the responsive mobile layout.

# Print Styles
Users often print recipes, therefore it is important to make sure the page prints correctly.

The print media query was used in order to style the print layout.
